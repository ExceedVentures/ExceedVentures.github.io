1. The First Meeting with the Girlfriend
My name is Minsu, and I’m a medical student—a pretty mediocre one, to be honest. I’ve failed two years in medical school. 
After my first failed year, I decided I needed a break, something to reset my mind and spirit. I scraped together every bit of savings I had and made a plan. “Why not spend a month in a quiet, remote part of Japan?” I thought. Somewhere peaceful, surrounded by nature, where I could just breathe and maybe figure out what went wrong.
I found this traditional Japanese guesthouse online, tucked away in a rural village far from the city. The place offered lodging and homemade meals, and it seemed like the perfect escape from the chaos of my life. So, I booked it.
When I arrived in Japan, I took the train out to the countryside, watching as the city slowly disappeared and was replaced by endless fields and mountains. At the station, a kind-looking older man greeted me. He was the owner of the guesthouse, and he offered to drive me there.
The drive through the countryside was breathtaking. It was late spring, and the cherry blossoms were just starting to bloom. The air was cool and fresh, a welcome change from the stuffy hospital rooms I’d been stuck in back home.
When we arrived at the guesthouse, the first thing I noticed was how peaceful it was. The house was old but well-maintained, with a beautiful garden out front. As I stepped out of the car, I was greeted by the owner’s daughter. She was the one who would eventually become my girlfriend, though I didn’t know it then.
She was quiet, almost shy, with a gentle smile that seemed to light up her whole face. She gave me a tour of the house, explaining the traditional features—the tatami mats, the sliding paper doors, the way the house was designed to let in as much natural light as possible. Her voice was soft, and she moved with a kind of grace that I found immediately captivating.
That first meeting was brief, but it stayed with me. There was something about her, something calming. Maybe it was the way she seemed so at ease in her surroundings, or the way she spoke with such care. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but I knew I wanted to get to know her better.
Little did I know, that simple tour of the house was the beginning of something much bigger. As the days went on, I found myself drawn to her, to the quiet life she led in this secluded village. Away from the noise and pressure of my usual life, I began to see things differently. And as I spent more time with her, I started to wonder if this place, this life, was what I had been searching for all along.
2.One Month in the Countryside
Honestly, I didn’t plan this trip very well, and it showed—especially in my budget. My girlfriend’s family ran a guesthouse that offered both lodging and traditional Japanese home-cooked meals. But despite staying there for a whole month, I didn’t sign up for a single meal. Later, when I asked her about it, she laughed and told me I was the first guest to do that.
The guesthouse was in a really remote area, far from any convenience stores or restaurants. If I wanted to eat, I had to travel into town, which was an hour’s walk each way. Even the bus fare was too much for my thin wallet, so for the first two weeks, I walked. Every day. An hour there and an hour back, just to grab some food.
Once in town, I’d make the most of the trip. After eating, I’d wander around, checking out the local schoolyards, parks, and any interesting little spots I could find. It was a strange mix of frustrating and liberating. Sure, I was broke, but there was something romantic about aimlessly exploring a foreign place.
That is, until I got reported to the police. One day, as I was wandering near a school, a local resident must have found me suspicious. Before I knew it, I was sitting in a police station, trying to explain myself. Of course, my passport was safely back at the guesthouse, and I didn’t speak a word of Japanese. After a lot of fumbling with my phone, I managed to show them the guesthouse address, and they contacted my girlfriend’s family to confirm I wasn’t some vagrant. They let me go, but not before giving me a long, hard look.
Later, I found out that my girlfriend’s father had told her about me. Apparently, he thought I was a well-meaning but hopelessly clumsy young man and asked her to keep an eye on me, just in case I got into any more trouble.
Before all this, I used to occasionally cross paths with my girlfriend on my way back to the guesthouse. She’d be riding her bike home from school, and we’d just pass each other without much interaction. But after my little adventure with the police, things changed. The next time we ran into each other, she stopped her bike, got off, and started talking to me. Then, we walked back to the guesthouse together.
We talked about why I didn’t take the bus, why I hadn’t signed up for any meals at the guesthouse, and a bunch of other things. With the help of Papago and her limited but surprisingly good Korean, we managed to communicate. I found out she’d been studying a bit of Korean because they had quite a few Korean guests, and she wanted to be able to help out more.
When she asked why I was so stingy, I remember awkwardly repeating, “Okanega naidesukara” (because I have no money). She laughed, but I was dead serious.
She also asked why I was spending a month in Japan. I struggled to explain my situation with medical school, and in the end, I blurted out, “I’m here because I’m at risk of being expelled from university.” Later, she told me that she was puzzled by this. She wondered, “If he’s on the brink of expulsion, why isn’t he studying? Why is he wandering around Japan instead?”
But despite her confusion, she must have felt some kind of sibling-like affection for me, because from that day on, she started bringing me extra food. Since she was the eldest of three siblings, she had this nurturing side, and I guess I triggered that instinct in her. She wasn’t making me full meals like the guesthouse offered, but she did make extra lunch for me when she packed her own for school.
She also lent me an old bicycle they had lying around, so I didn’t have to walk to town anymore. It made the rest of my stay much more comfortable.
At that time, neither of us saw each other as anything more than just acquaintances. I was just thinking, “Wow, Japanese people really are kind,” while she probably thought of me as a hapless younger brother who needed looking after.
Little did we know, that month would lay the foundation for something much deeper.
3. One Month in the Countryside (Part 2)
As the days in the small village passed, I found myself helping out more and more around the guesthouse. In exchange for the food and hospitality, I started assisting with various chores—carrying blankets for guests, moving groceries, and even helping with some of the cleaning. It might sound odd to spend a vacation this way, but without much money and having already explored the entire village, there wasn’t much else for me to do.
After two weeks of wandering around and barely speaking to anyone, I was starving for conversation. The only person I could somewhat communicate with was her—the daughter of the guesthouse owners. She was busy after school, always helping with the family business. Since she was the eldest, a lot of responsibility fell on her shoulders.
At first, she was surprised by my eagerness to help. “You really don’t need to do this,” she insisted, looking at me with a mix of confusion and amusement.
I just shrugged. “I’ve got nothing better to do. Plus, it’s nice to have someone to talk to, even if it’s just while working.”
She didn’t say anything, but I noticed that she didn’t argue much after that. Maybe she realized I wasn’t going to give up. Every time I saw her carrying something or cleaning, I’d appear at her side, asking, “Need help?” or “I’m really not busy, you know.”
Eventually, she just accepted it. “Fine,” she’d say with a small sigh, but I could tell she appreciated the help. Or maybe she just got tired of arguing with me.
One day, as I awkwardly tried to help her fold some blankets, she glanced over at me and smirked. “You’re not very good at this, are you?”
I laughed, realizing I had probably made more of a mess than before. “Yeah, maybe cleaning isn’t my strong suit. But at least I’m good for carrying heavy stuff, right?”
She nodded, still smiling. “Yes, that’s true. You’re very helpful with that.”
The most useful I ever felt was when Korean guests had complaints or requests. My Japanese was far from perfect, and I often relied on translation apps, but it was still easier for me to understand and communicate with them than it was for her. I became the unofficial translator, and I could tell it made things smoother for her.
One evening, after dealing with a particularly picky guest, she turned to me, visibly relieved. “You make things easier, you know.”
I grinned. “Glad to help. I don’t want to just freeload here.”
“You’re not freeloading,” she said earnestly. “You’re helping a lot.”
As the nights grew longer, there were times when she needed to go to the storage shed, which was a bit of a walk from the main house. The first time she asked me to come with her, I didn’t think much of it until we stepped out into the darkness. The village was pitch-black at night, and the silence was almost eerie.
“Are we sure it’s safe out here?” I joked, trying to sound casual, but I couldn’t hide my nervousness.
She looked at me, stifling a laugh. “Are you scared?”
“Scared? No, just… cautious,” I replied, failing to convince even myself.
As we reached the shed, the creaking door didn’t do much to ease my nerves, but she moved around calmly, gathering what she needed. I tried to ignore the unsettling atmosphere, but she noticed my discomfort and chuckled softly. “No monsters here, Min-su. You’re safe.”
“Good to know,” I muttered, feeling a little embarrassed.
On our way back, the tension had lifted, and I found myself talking more freely. We chatted about small things—her school, my time in Japan, and why I had come here in the first place. It wasn’t much, but it felt like we were slowly getting to know each other better.
As my departure date approached, I realized I had grown attached to this routine, to the small, quiet life we had shared for a brief time. Before I left, we exchanged contact information. I had to set up a new account on the spot, but I was determined to keep in touch.
“If you ever visit Korea, let me know,” I told her. “I’ll show you around and repay the favor.”
She smiled, teasing me slightly. “Even if I have no money?”
I laughed, remembering our earlier conversations. “By then, I’ll be working, a proper adult. I’ll take care of everything.”
She nodded, her smile softening. “Just don’t say ‘Okanega naidesukara’ anymore.”
I promised I wouldn’t, and with that, we parted ways. As I boarded the bus back to the city, I couldn’t help but think about how much I had changed in just a month. What started as an escape had turned into something much more meaningful.
4. Online Friendship
Returning to Korea, life settled back into its usual routine. The hustle of medical school resumed, but one thing remained constant—my daily interactions with her. We had become something akin to online friends. Every day, there was a message or two exchanged between us. It wasn’t anything intense, just enough to keep the connection alive.
I soon realized that the account she was using to talk to me was primarily for language exchange with Korean friends she’d met online. It was no wonder she had been so good at picking up the little Korean phrases I taught her. Inspired by this, I decided to take my Japanese seriously for the first time in my life. I started studying for the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test), thinking it might be fun to get certified. 
But, to be honest, I struggled. The kanji, the grammar—it was all much harder than I’d anticipated. My medical studies were already overwhelming, so Japanese ended up being more of a side hobby than a serious pursuit. In the end, I didn’t pass the JLPT, and I didn’t get very far with the language. But our conversations continued, and that was what mattered.
Over the next year, we continued to be “just friends,” exchanging messages regularly. We’d talk about whatever was on our minds—questions about our respective countries, language tips, and, of course, a lot of random chatter. She often shared stories about her school life and friends. I learned she was in the basketball club, and she’d often talk about her practices and games.
One memory that stands out is when she casually mentioned getting a confession from a senior in her club. 
“I got a confession from one of my senpai today,” she typed one evening. 
I remember feeling a weird pang in my chest as I read it, but I brushed it off. “Oh? How do you feel about that?”
“I don’t know,” she replied. “He’s nice, but... I want someone more mature, someone I can rely on. He’s still a bit too childish.”
I chuckled, remembering our own conversations. “I think all guys have a bit of a childish side. It’s part of our charm.”
She quickly shot back, “Seeing you, I can’t argue with that 😜.”
“Hey! That’s a low blow,” I responded, laughing at her teasing. “I’m an adult, you know! It hurts that you’re comparing me to a high school kid!”
“Just kidding,” she replied with a playful “www” (her favorite way of laughing online).
Looking back now, I realize those conversations might have stung a little, but at the time, we were both so firmly in the “just friends” zone that it didn’t really bother me. 
Time passed, and we stayed in this comfortable, platonic rhythm. But everything changed one cold winter day when two things happened almost simultaneously. First, I learned that I had failed another year in medical school—a second academic setback that left me devastated. And just as I was processing that blow, a message popped up on my phone.
“I’m coming to Korea! 😊” she wrote.
5. Ghosting and Struggling 
After returning to Korea, my relationship with my Japanese girlfriend evolved into something like an online friendship. We exchanged messages daily, sometimes just a few words, but it was consistent. Then, out of nowhere, she told me she was planning to visit Korea. And I... I just ghosted her.
It was late November or early December—I can’t remember exactly—but for nearly a month, I read all her messages and didn't reply. To be honest, by the time the second semester started, I already sensed that I was heading for my second academic failure. Although I was keeping up appearances with her, my situation was far from okay.
Looking back, I think my first failure was due to slacking off and underestimating the workload. But this second failure? It was a toxic mix of insecurity and arrogance. The reality was that I was falling behind, not just my original classmates but now even those who were a year below me. In medical school, where hierarchy and seniority are deeply ingrained, I began to feel like I no longer belonged anywhere.
Having retaken the entrance exam more than once and now facing not one but two academic failures in med school, I was drowning in feelings of inferiority and self-doubt. The thought of dropping out and finding a different path started to seem like a reasonable option. I was trying to convince myself that maybe medicine was never meant for me in the first place. My grades, naturally, reflected this downward spiral—unlike the first time when I just barely failed one course, this time, I was failing across the board.
It’s incredible how quickly things can fall apart. Once I realized I was on the path to a second failure, I stopped attending classes altogether. I spent most days locked away in my room, only stepping out to do short-term jobs when they came up. This continued for about two to three months, as I avoided reality and sank deeper into my own despair.
Haha, my story went on for too long. The bottom line is that in the state I was in, meeting anyone was the last thing I wanted. I just wanted to avoid everyone. I mean, here I was, pretending to have my life together when texting a high school student, but in reality, I was teetering on the edge, thinking about dropping out of med school. The thought of meeting someone, especially her, and pretending everything was fine… That was beyond me.
Even though I wasn’t responding, she kept messaging me.
“I’ve booked my flight.”
“I’ll be in Korea from [date] to [date].”
“Is everything okay?”
“Please let me know if I did something wrong.”
“Why aren’t you answering?”
She kept reaching out like this. I read every single message, but I deliberately didn’t reply. I figured if I just ignored her long enough, she’d get the hint, and the messages would stop on their own. Eventually, they did. She got tired of my silence and stopped sending them.
I thought that was the end of it. And honestly, I felt like I deserved it. I spent the rest of the year in a haze, feeling empty and directionless as time passed by.
But then, one evening, just as the year was drawing to a close, I got a message from her.
"I'm coming to Korea tomorrow. If you're reading this, answer me, you liar."
There was something in that scolding tone that felt oddly comforting, even endearing. I should've stuck to my original plan and ignored it, but instead, I found myself replying.
"I'm sorry. I hope you have a great time in Korea."
"Why are you suddenly being so formal? Am I causing you trouble by coming?"
"No, it's not that."
"Did you get a girlfriend or something?"
"No, no girlfriend."
"Is it about money?"
"Haha, I have some money, at least."
"This time, you're acting like a real adult."
"Really? I’m not sure about that."
That’s how our conversation went after such a long time of silence. But when she mentioned "acting like a real adult," I couldn’t help but feel a bit deflated again.
"I still think you'll do just fine when you need to act like an adult."
"Even though I haven't seen it yet 😜"
"Haha, if you run into any trouble when you’re here, just let me know. I’ll help out as much as I can."
And with that, we ended our conversation on a good note. Above all, I was relieved that we could maintain some sense of normalcy between us.
Just as I was starting to feel relieved, a problem arose the very next day.
"I lost my wallet and can’t get back to my accommodation. I’m at [00 Station], and my phone battery is about to die. I think I’ll have to stay here."
I saw this message about an hour after she sent it.
Reaching the station she mentioned would take me several hours even if I left immediately. Plus, I wasn't too eager to meet up in person, so my first thought was to send her some money. However, when I tried to reply, I received no response, probably because her phone had already died.
Honestly, even if I did manage to get to the station, finding her in such a large place was uncertain. She might have already found some help and made it back to her accommodation by the time I arrived. 
But I decided to head to the station anyway. It seemed like the only option left, and I had plenty of time on my hands, especially with my second year of failing school looming over me.
I figured even if I had to spend the night searching for her and ended up waiting for the first train of the morning in an internet cafe, it would still be worth it. After all, helping out a high school student traveling alone in a foreign country was meaningful in itself.
Finding someone in a large station with no clues to go on was far from easy. After arriving, I spent more than two to three hours searching every corner of the station. I checked all the exits and even combed through the shops and cafes, making sure not to miss any groups of people where she might be. I circled the same areas three or four times, thinking maybe we just missed each other while she was in the restroom. I couldn’t enter the women’s restroom, so I waited outside for ten minutes a couple of times, hoping she’d emerge. I even used my transit card to get past the ticket barriers and searched the platforms, wondering if she might’ve gone underground.
Despite all this effort, I couldn’t find any trace of her, and her messages remained unanswered. I started to feel a mix of frustration and worry.
"Did she leave before I got here?"
"Maybe she’s already back at her accommodation, helped by someone else."
"Could she have moved to a different location?"
Just as my thoughts started spiraling, I overheard a conversation between two people who looked like friends:
“She wasn’t inside the station; she was outside!”
“My bad, I thought she’d come up since it was too crowded inside.”
At that moment, I realized I hadn’t checked just outside the station’s exits. I quickly headed there, and sure enough, I found her. She was sitting on a small brick ledge near a building just outside one of the exits. I couldn’t understand why she’d be out there in the freezing cold instead of staying inside the warm station, but at that moment, finding her was all that mattered.
I was about to suggest we head back to her accommodation when she spoke up.
“Liar.”
“Huh?”
“I’m sorry. I lied too.”
She reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone, which was still on and fully charged.
“I still have my wallet too.”
She showed me her wallet, and I realized she had tricked me. Naturally, after trekking all the way to the station and spending hours searching, only to find out it was all a lie, I felt a surge of frustration—like I’d been smacked in the back of the head. But seeing her sitting there, cold and alone in a foreign country, I couldn’t bring myself to get angry.
I held back my frustration and asked, “Why did you do this?”
“Why didn’t you reply to my messages?”
“…”
“I’m sorry for lying. But I thought if I didn’t, you wouldn’t come to see me.”
It felt like I was the one being scolded for ignoring her messages, and the chance to be angry at her slipped away just like that.
It was freezing outside, so we headed back into the station, where we ended up talking about all sorts of things. When I asked her what she would have done if I hadn’t shown up, she just smiled and said, “But you came, didn’t you? 😜” She had no backup plan at all—typical of her, right?
Despite all my worries, our conversation flowed naturally, just like it had when we were in Japan. Maybe it was because we’d spent over a year as online friends, building some kind of inner closeness. She even seemed bolder than she had been in Japan, more comfortable with me now.
She mentioned she was hungry since she’d been waiting for me without having dinner. It was already really late, so I offered to get her something from a convenience store, but she turned me down.
“I wanted to try PC bang food! Please show me the way. I’m counting on you 😜,” she said. Apparently, one of her bucket list items for her trip to Korea was to spend the night at a PC bang, trying all the different snacks and dishes they offered.
So, I gave up on sending her back to her accommodation and took her to a PC bang instead. It wasn’t what I had planned, but we ended up spending the night there, ordering various PC bang foods. I hadn’t eaten dinner either since I’d rushed straight to the station to find her, so I was starving too.
Since she was underage, I remember having to pretend she was my cousin from abroad who I was showing around. Somehow, we managed to get in. 
She tried tteokbokki with ramen (rabokki) for the first time that night, and it’s still one of her favorite dishes. If I remember correctly, she liked it so much that she thought the portion was too small when we shared it, so we ordered a second one! 😂
We didn’t play many games—she wasn’t much of a gamer anyway. Instead, we spent the night watching YouTube, mostly travel videos, and chatting while snacking on all the food. It was something like, “Have you been here?” “Nope.” “What about here?” “Not yet.” “You don’t know much about Seoul, do you?” “I’m not from Seoul!” 😂 We also typed messages on the computers, which sped up our communication since we could type faster than on our phones.
Looking back, that dark, gloomy year ended on a much brighter note, thanks to her. That night at the PC bang was probably the first time in a long while that I’d had so much fun without any of the usual complicated thoughts weighing me down.
We stayed at the PC bang until the first subway of the morning started running. We were both exhausted from staying up all night, so I decided I should at least see her back to her accommodation. We took the subway together, chatting along the way, though half the time we were both barely keeping our eyes open.
One key moment from that early morning was when she brought up the New Year’s Eve bell ringing.
“Do you know about the New Year’s Eve bell?”
“Yeah, of course.”
“I really want to see it. Can you take me there tomorrow?”
“I’ve never seen it in person either… only on TV.”
“That’s okay. I trust you 😜.”
And just like that, I found myself roped into guiding her to the New Year’s Eve bell ceremony the next day. 😂
Looking back, I realize how much she had me wrapped around her finger back then. I couldn’t say no to her!
After making plans to show her the Bosingak Bell on New Year’s Eve, I didn’t go home. Instead, I headed straight to a jjimjilbang (Korean sauna). It didn’t make sense to travel all the way back home and then return since I had already been up all night and just needed a place to rest.
At that time, I still didn’t see her as a romantic interest. If I had, I probably would’ve gone home to change into better clothes for our next meeting. Guiding her to see the Bosingak Bell felt more like chaperoning a student on a field trip or showing a tutoring student around a university campus.
She likely spent most of that day sleeping at her accommodation, then explored Seoul in the evening and the next day before we met again. She mentioned having plans to meet another Korean friend for sightseeing.
As for me, after getting some rest at the jjimjilbang, I spent the following day playing games at a PC bang. However, I did take my guiding duties seriously enough to do some research on Bosingak Bell and its history, so don’t judge me too harshly!
When the evening of December 31st finally arrived, we met at a café near the station close to Bosingak. Since the bell would only ring late at night, we needed a warm place to hang out until then—it was way too cold to stay outside.
Our conversation mostly revolved around what she had done with her Korean friend. I vividly remember her telling me about how she defended me when talking to her friend. Apparently, she told her friend, “He may not have much money and might not seem reliable, but I don’t think he’s a bad person.” 
Her friend, however, was not convinced and gave her a one-hour lecture. Understandably, since the friend seemed to be an adult woman, it was only natural for her to worry.
When I asked her what she had said about me that led to such a long discussion with her friend, she just smiled and replied, “It’s a conversation between girls, so I can’t tell you everything.” But then she added, “Since it’s you, I’ll give you a hint.”
She leaned in and whispered, “お金がないですから😜” (Okane ga nai desu kara, "Because you don't have money"). 
I couldn’t help but laugh and immediately admitted, “Yeah, I can’t argue with that.” 
After staying at the café for a while, we decided to head out and explore the city. It was getting a bit boring just sitting there, so we walked around, chatting as we noticed the remnants of Christmas decorations still up in Seoul. Whenever she wanted to take a photo, I’d stop and snap a picture for her. As we wandered through the streets, we saw musicians performing, people dancing, others collecting donations, and countless couples and families enjoying the evening together.
The walk to Bosingak, where the New Year’s bell would ring, was long—over an hour, because we didn’t take the subway. If there was anything unusual about it, it was probably the fact that we walked the entire way.
At one point, she remarked, “Korea definitely feels colder than Japan.”
I replied, “So why did you get off the subway all of a sudden?”
She grinned, “I’m on a special trip, so it wouldn’t mean much if I just stayed on the subway the whole time.”
I sighed, “But it’s exhausting…”
She shot back, “How did you manage to walk those long distances in Japan?”
I smirked, “Because I didn’t have any money…”
She laughed, “Let’s just say you’re broke this time too 😜.”
That’s how I ended up being dragged along on that walk. In Japan, I used to think of those long strolls as part of the romantic adventure of being abroad, but in Seoul, well… I’m not sure if walking around the city still carries that same sense of romance.
It's true that some people might imagine there was a hint of romance in the air during that night. And, well, there were a few moments that could give off that vibe, even if that wasn’t what we were aiming for. 
For instance, when she mentioned feeling cold, I couldn't just ignore it. With plenty of time before the bell-ringing at Bosingak, we ducked into an old pojangmacha (street food stall) to warm up with some odeng (fish cake) and used the paper cups filled with hot broth as makeshift hand warmers while we continued our walk. 
At one point, we wandered into an underground shopping mall connected to a subway station to escape the biting wind. There was a small stall selling gloves at a cheap price, so I bought her a pair to help with the cold. It was freezing that night—I distinctly remember the snowflakes falling sporadically, and considering we spent almost two hours outside, the cold was no joke. If you've ever walked around in Seoul during winter, you'd know exactly how harsh that can be.
She teased me, saying, “Is it okay to buy things like this for a girl you’ve only met twice?”
I joked back, “We met a lot in Japan, though.”
She replied with a grin, “But in Korea, it’s only the second time😜.”
I laughed, “In Korea, sometimes people give flowers and confess their feelings when they meet someone the second time.”
She chuckled, “I would’ve been in trouble if you had done that, but I’m relieved it’s just gloves 😜.”
Later, she said, “The gloves are warm, thank you.”
Feeling a bit nostalgic, I added, “Now that you mention it, thanks for the bento you made for me in Japan.”
“It was just because I was already making it for myself 😜,” she responded.
“Same here, I just happened to buy an extra pair while getting mine,” I replied with a smile. We kept the banter going, trying to shake off the cold and keep our spirits up as we pushed on through the winter night.
Despite my original plan to take it easy, we eventually pushed through the freezing temperatures and made it near Bosingak. By the time we arrived, it was too late to get close enough to actually see the bell, but we could still hear it from where we were.
I think I grumbled, “We should’ve taken the subway…”
She reassured me with a smile, “But we can still hear it, right?”
“Yeah, but we can’t see it,” I said.
She softly replied, “That’s okay. We’ve seen so many other great things tonight☺️.”
Looking back, I think she ended up comforting me more than I did her.
Not long after, the bell began to toll. Even though neither of us could actually see the bell, we both stood there staring off into the distance, looking in the direction where we imagined it might be. It was almost comical—two people, standing side by side, gazing into the night, listening to each strike of the bell as if it were some kind of sacred ritual.
The sound of the bell seemed to stretch on forever, but eventually, it rang for the 33rd and final time. The crowd around us buzzed with excitement, celebrating the arrival of the New Year. I figured I should say something too, to mark the occasion.
But before I could, she turned to me and said, "Mr. Liar."
"?"
"I'm still young, so I don’t really understand adult problems."
"???"
"But I can tell just by looking at your face that something is going on."
"..."
"I probably bothered you a lot since I came to Korea."
"..."
"If I did, I’m sorry. But I can’t just leave someone alone when they have that look on their face."
"..."
"That’s why I brought you here."
"..."
"If something bad happened, I hope you can forget about it after hearing those bells."
Her words caught me completely off guard. To be honest, looking back, it would be a lie to say I wasn’t at least a little annoyed at times. Sure, maybe I was the one who stopped responding out of nowhere, and yeah, running around Seoul, scouring subway stations, pulling an all-nighter at a PC bang, and then braving the winter cold for nearly two hours to guide her to Bosingak—none of that was easy.
But somehow, in that moment, all the frustration and the hopelessness I’d been feeling about possibly failing and repeating the year just vanished. It amazed me that someone still in high school could be so insightful, more so than I was at that time. Sure, she had her childish moments, but there was something fundamentally different about the way she thought and spoke.
As I listened to her, the one thought that crossed my mind was, "This person deserves to be happy more than anyone else. At least, that’s how I feel."
If I had to pinpoint the exact moment when I first started having romantic feelings, it was probably that night. Of course, I wasn't aware of it at the time.
As the crowd gradually dispersed, we also began to make our way back. Nothing particularly significant happened as we walked—just some lighthearted banter and trivial conversations, like why she kept calling me "Mr. Liar" or how she was surprised the bell really did ring 33 times.
The next day, she flew back to Japan. I didn’t see her off at the airport. If she had asked me to, I probably would have gone, but she assured me that there was no need for any more hassle, so I didn’t. 
From that point on, we started messaging on LINE. I wished her a safe trip home, not knowing when we’d see each other again, but still keeping in touch.
Even after she returned, we continued to chat regularly, more like pen pals than anything else. I didn’t ghost her like I did before. 
It’s true what they say—people change because of other people. After that encounter, I turned things around. I managed to pass my exams and finally escaped the shadow of potential failure that had been looming over me. She also had good news; she passed her entrance exams, graduated high school, and became a university student.
As she settled into university life, our conversations became more casual, filled with the usual experiences of a new student. Stuff like, “I tried alcohol for the first time,” or “I got a part-time job!”—the typical milestones of entering adulthood.
For over a year, we fell back into the routine of being online friends. The emotions I felt when we listened to the New Year’s bell together gradually faded, but I never lost the sense of gratitude and the hope that she would be happy. I still believed she was a good person who deserved the best. The main difference was that she kept improving her Korean, making friends and getting better at the language, while my Japanese skills... well, let’s just say they stayed the same.
Then, everything changed again when she told me she was coming back to Korea. The message went something like this:
“I’m coming to Korea as an exchange student! This time, no more ‘Mr. Liar,’ okay? 😜”
6. The Exchange Student
My girlfriend arrived in Korea just as the sweltering summer was beginning to give way to the cool embrace of autumn. At the time, I was working as an intern at a hospital, juggling long shifts and the demands of practical training. Fortunately, she had flown in early, in August, before her semester started. Because of this, I was spared from hearing her call me “Mr. Liar” again. It was still my summer break, after all.
Her main goal for coming to Korea early was to find a place to live and set up her room before classes began. A few weeks before she arrived, she had asked me if I could spare a day to help her out. Knowing there’d be heavy things to carry while shopping, I figured she needed someone to help with the bags—basically, a pack mule.
But there was one thing I hadn’t expected when we met up.
“Hello, my sister has been imposing on you. I'm Kyooji, her younger brother.”
I had assumed she would be coming alone, but it turned out she had brought her younger brother along.
When I first met her younger brother, it was during one of my trips to Japan. We had crossed paths a few times, but I never had a proper conversation with him. He seemed quiet and reserved, quite different from his sister. So, it was a surprise to see him standing there in Korea. 
He was a high school student, and since it was his summer break, it seemed his sister had brought him along to help with the move and perhaps to show him around Korea. And then there was her—my girlfriend. It was the first time I'd seen her in person since she became a university student. Although we had kept in touch, exchanging photos occasionally, seeing her in person was different. She had grown even more beautiful, which caught me off guard. She used to dress quite plainly, but now she had a more polished look.
"You really look like a college student now. You've gotten pretty good at makeup," I commented, half-jokingly.
"I'm not missing out on either the Japanese or Korean styles. 🤗"
"Have you been studying makeup more than your actual classes?"
"Well, I studied enough to come here as an exchange student, so I guess it's fine. 😜"
We exchanged banter like this, catching up as we walked. 
Her brother, however, wasn’t having it. 
“What kind of conversation is this? When are we going to the apartment?”
He kept interrupting our conversation, reminding us of the real reason we were there. 
The apartment she had chosen was a typical studio in the heart of Seoul. It wasn’t too big or too small, just enough for one person. What I remember most was that it was a new building because she wanted to avoid any run-ins with bugs. She was really insistent on that point.
In the midst of all the errands and shopping, I was asked to help her get set up in her new place. We ended up visiting places like NewCore Outlet and Hi-Mart for electronics, as well as stores for essentials like desks, chairs, bedding, cups, and kitchenware—pretty much everything you’d need to start living on your own. Her younger brother, though, seemed to struggle with all the running around. I could tell he was getting exhausted, which was understandable given the sweltering August heat.
Throughout the day, I kept emphasizing, “We don’t have to carry everything home today. You can order most of this stuff online through sites like Coupang, and they’ll deliver it to your door,” and “Don’t worry about getting everything done today. We can take it easy and focus on the essentials.” I was trying to minimize what we had to lug around since it was already hot, and adding a ton of heavy bags would just make it worse.
Thankfully, my efforts seemed to pay off. We spent most of our time browsing the stores, making lists of what to buy later and what could be delivered. We saved the actual purchases for last, stopping by the Daiso near her new place to pick up only the essentials—things that were cheap and easy to carry. Despite my best efforts to keep the load light, we still ended up with a fair amount of stuff, but it could have been much worse.
After the long and tedious shopping spree, and once we’d finished setting up the apartment, she brought up something interesting.
“I heard that in Korea, friends help each other move, and afterward, the person moving treats everyone to a meal as a thank you.”
“Is that why you asked me to help?” I teased.
“Yes, I wanted to try it since I’m in Korea now. 🤗”
“But this wasn’t even a real move, and I’m not exactly a friend...” her brother chimed in.
“It felt kind of like it, didn’t it? ☺️”
“...Yeah, I guess it did.”
Honestly, I was relieved. If she had called in actual friends to help, it would have been a much bigger ordeal, especially in the middle of summer. I’m sure her brother was thankful it was just the three of us.
After everything was settled, we went out to eat—sizzling kimchi pork belly on a hot plate. I remember both of them really enjoyed it, and their reactions were priceless. They were clearly delighted by the taste, and it was a nice way to end a busy day.
After helping with what could loosely be called moving, there was a period where I didn't see her much. I was busy with my hospital internship, and she was just starting to settle into her life as an exchange student in Korea, so it was natural. Still, we kept in touch regularly, asking about each other's well-being, and sometimes she'd send me a message to vent.
"How do you make Korean friends at university? It’s harder than I thought now that I’m here."
"Just be yourself, like you are with me."
"No way! I want to be popular at university. 😜"
"?"
Conversations like that were common, as well as exchanges like:
"Do you drink Americano often?"
"I have it every morning."
"Koreans seem to drink it a lot, even though it's bitter."
"I'm adults, after all. 😏"
"an old man. 😜"
"?"
We’d joke around like that, mostly talking about her life in Korea, friends, and day-to-day stuff. It kept us close, despite the distance. If either of us had suggested meeting up, we probably would have without hesitation. She was living in Seoul on her own, and when her second semester ended, she immediately booked a flight back to Japan to see her family. My program kept me busy with long semesters and short breaks, so we didn’t get a chance to meet during that entire semester.
What came next wasn’t another meeting, but something we all know too well: COVID-19. Shortly after my friend returned to Japan to visit her family, she flew back to Korea just as the virus started to make its impact. It wasn’t long before Japan, and the rest of the world, followed suit. We all know what happened, so I’ll skip the details.
When the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Korea and the virus began to spread nationwide, any plans to meet up with her became uncertain. Despite that, we kept in touch regularly, exchanging simple greetings and checking in on each other. She was understandably upset, saying things like, “It’s so sad that something like this happened after I finally came to Korea as an exchange student. 😔”
Under normal circumstances, it seemed like there would be no chance for us to meet. But surprisingly, the pandemic became a pivotal point in our relationship. It was well into the semester when I received an unexpected message from her:
"Are you still busy with your studies?"
I replied, "Not as busy as you might think."
Then she dropped a bombshell.
"Actually, I’ve tested positive for COVID."
I immediately asked, "Are you okay?"
"I want to say yes, but honestly, I'm not. So…"
At this point, she called me. If I remember correctly, this was the first time we ever spoke on the phone. Her voice was raspy, weak, and it was clear she was struggling to speak.
"If it’s not too much trouble… could you come over?"
Without thinking, I replied instinctively, "I’ll be there."
As soon as I heard her faint “Thank you,” I hung up and left the campus immediately.
Actually, that day, my hospital practicum wasn’t even over yet. But with her saying she had COVID and was feeling terrible, I quickly made up an excuse, telling my practicum group that I was feeling under the weather and might have caught a cold, so I wouldn’t be able to finish the shift and would head home instead. It was more of an abrupt announcement than a request. As I rushed out, a small part of me thought, *I probably should’ve finished that shift…*, but I was already halfway to the station by then. I caught the first train to Seoul, muttering to myself about how reckless I was being. In hindsight, it was a pretty risky move, considering I might have ended up failing the practicum.
When I arrived in Seoul, I tried to contact her as I got closer to her place, but she didn’t pick up. I figured she must be asleep, so I just sent her a message and waited at a nearby PC bang, killing time until I heard back.
“Sorry, I was sleeping. 🥹” 
She finally replied after a while.
“Do you need anything?” I asked.
“Could you bring me some porridge? My throat hurts too much to eat anything else.”
And just like that, I ended up taking care of her for the next few days. I remember renting a small room at a goshiwon near her place, staying there for about four days, including the weekend. I’d spend most of the day doing my own work, then run errands for her whenever she needed something.
“Are you sure you’re okay staying here?”
“Thank you so much.”
“Are you really alright?”
At first, she seemed apologetic about asking for my help. But as she started feeling better, her messages became more playful.
“I think I’d feel better if I had some rabokki.”
“It’s boring being stuck inside all day.”
“I’m afraid I’ll forget what your voice sounds like.”
Meanwhile, I was stressing about missing two full days of practicum, which wasn’t great. But honestly, if it hadn’t been for her, I probably wouldn’t have made it through the practicum in the first place, so maybe it didn’t matter that much.
By the fourth day, she seemed to be recovering, so I told her I was planning to head back.
“I think you’re doing better now, so I’ll head back.”
“Could you do one last thing for me?”
“Do you need anything?”
“Can you cook me some ramen?”
“Can’t I just bring you a cup ramen with hot water?”
“No, I want you to come inside and cook it here.”
I remember thinking, *What’s with her?* But before I could respond, she added:
“I also want to talk to you about something. But if that’s too much to ask, it’s okay.”
Looking back, I don’t know what got into me, but I ended up going into her apartment, despite knowing she was still recovering from COVID. Of course, I made sure to follow basic safety protocols, like wearing a mask, but still—it was definitely a bold move.
When I stepped into her room, it was pretty clear that it wasn’t in the best condition, as you'd expect. She was sitting on her bed, wrapped in blankets, with a mask covering her face. She gave me a quick glance, nodded slightly in greeting, and then turned her head away, murmuring something that sounded like “hello” in a low voice.
As I entered and received her quiet greeting, I immediately started preparing to cook the ramen. Not long after, I noticed she had turned away from me, fully covered under her blanket, and was calling me on the phone—even though I was right there in the same room.
“You could just talk to me directly,” I said, trying to ignore the call and focus on cooking, but she kept calling until I finally gave in and answered.
“I can barely talk, and I don’t want to risk spreading COVID to you,” she whispered over the phone.
“I’ve already been exposed since the moment I walked in, so it doesn’t matter now,” I replied.
“But I’d still rather talk on the phone,” she insisted.
“I’m cooking here, you know.”
“Can’t you just humor a sick person for a bit? You’re going to be a doctor, after all.”
“I’m just a med student, remember?”
“Consider it practice, then,” she teased.
“Alright, let’s save this for when you’re fully recovered.”
“By the way,” she said after a brief pause, “having someone else in the house really does make me feel better.”
There was a certain vulnerability in her voice as she admitted it, and then she started to share just how rough it had been.
“I’ve been in so much pain, I couldn’t even sleep.”
“I couldn’t even drink water,” she continued, her voice soft and full of fatigue.
“Did you tell your family?” I asked.
“I didn’t tell them everything, just that I had COVID.”
“Why not?”
“They’re far away. I can’t complain to them and make them worry. They’d just stress over it.”
Despite her illness, she was trying to be strong for her family. After I finished cooking, I placed the ramen on the desk. She slowly crawled out from under the covers, still holding her phone, and pleaded, “Please don’t leave. Stay until I’m done eating.”
I reassured her that I’d stick around, even promising to do the dishes afterward, so she shouldn’t worry and just focus on eating. To follow the COVID guidelines, I made sure she sat facing away from me as she ate. We continued to chat through our phones, even though we were just a few feet apart.
“Actually, I told my brother about how sick I was.”
“Oh? And what did he say?”
“He told me to ask a friend for help,” she replied.
“And that’s why you called me?”
“Yes,” she admitted, a small smile in her voice. “You were the first person I thought of, someone I knew would come. My brother even said, ‘If it’s that guy, he’ll definitely show up.’” ☺️
She had a way of making comments that would often catch me off guard, leaving me wondering if she was doing it on purpose or just being playful.
“It's weird having someone standing behind me while I eat,” she said.
“Well, it's just as weird watching you from here,” I joked back.
“But now that I think about it, it’s better than you watching me eat from the front. That would be too embarrassing,” she teased, adding a playful emoji to the conversation.
She also said things that made me question her intentions. For instance, at one point she mentioned, “Sorry, if I had a boyfriend, I wouldn’t have bothered you like this.”
“You can’t just decide to have one, though,” I responded.
“True, but it would be nice, right? To have someone to lean on?”
“Yeah, it would.”
“But I don’t think I’ll be getting one anytime soon,” she said, a bit cryptically.
“Why not?” I asked, a little confused.
“Because I have you here in Korea. Who needs a boyfriend when I have you? So, I hope you’ll keep helping me out in the future, too. 😜”
It was her usual mix of teasing and sincerity, leaving me wondering how serious she was.
Then, out of nowhere, she added, “I see you in a new light after all this.”
“What do you mean?” I asked.
“You’re someone I can really rely on in times like these.”
“Is that a compliment?” I replied, laughing a bit awkwardly.
“Yes, it is. I’m just saying thank you.☺️”
We talked a lot during that short time—probably more than we ever had before. I started to see sides of her I hadn’t noticed before, like how she could be so vulnerable and playful at the same time. It was like I was finally getting to see the real her, not just the version she usually showed to the world.
So, in the end, I realized that going into her room, making her ramen, and doing the dishes wasn’t just about helping a sick friend. It was an eye-opening experience where I learned more about who she really was, and in turn, I began to understand my own feelings better.
Afterward, I had to face the consequences of my actions. Missing two days of my hospital rotations wasn’t something I could just brush off. I ended up having to go to my professor and explain the situation—that I had been taking care of a friend who had COVID. Luckily, the professor was understanding and let me make up for the missed days by writing a few extra reports, so I avoided any serious repercussions. It helped that at the time, anything COVID-related was given some leeway.
However, there was an unexpected twist. Because I had been in close contact with a COVID-positive person—going so far as to enter her room and interact with her—I was required to self-isolate for an additional three to four days, meaning I couldn’t return to my rotations immediately. When I told her about it, she felt incredibly guilty, but I reassured her that it was fine. COVID had already been disrupting everything, and many of my peers were also missing rotations here and there.
But honestly, all of that—the aftermath, the self-isolation, the extra reports—didn’t seem to matter much.
What really mattered was that I had come to a realization. I had managed to get through all of it without too much trouble, but in the process, I had started to ask myself why I had been so willing to drop everything and rush to her side. After thinking it over, I came to a single conclusion.
Whether I had known it consciously or not, I had already started seeing her in a special way.
This was the first time I truly realized that I might have romantic feelings for her.
