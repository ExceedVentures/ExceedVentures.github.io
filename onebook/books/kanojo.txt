1. The First Meeting with the Girlfriend
My name is Minsu, and I’m a medical student—a pretty mediocre one, to be honest. I’ve failed two years in medical school. 
After my first failed year, I decided I needed a break, something to reset my mind and spirit. I scraped together every bit of savings I had and made a plan. “Why not spend a month in a quiet, remote part of Japan?” I thought. Somewhere peaceful, surrounded by nature, where I could just breathe and maybe figure out what went wrong.
I found this traditional Japanese guesthouse online, tucked away in a rural village far from the city. The place offered lodging and homemade meals, and it seemed like the perfect escape from the chaos of my life. So, I booked it.
When I arrived in Japan, I took the train out to the countryside, watching as the city slowly disappeared and was replaced by endless fields and mountains. At the station, a kind-looking older man greeted me. He was the owner of the guesthouse, and he offered to drive me there.
The drive through the countryside was breathtaking. It was late spring, and the cherry blossoms were just starting to bloom. The air was cool and fresh, a welcome change from the stuffy hospital rooms I’d been stuck in back home.
When we arrived at the guesthouse, the first thing I noticed was how peaceful it was. The house was old but well-maintained, with a beautiful garden out front. As I stepped out of the car, I was greeted by the owner’s daughter. She was the one who would eventually become my girlfriend, though I didn’t know it then.
She was quiet, almost shy, with a gentle smile that seemed to light up her whole face. She gave me a tour of the house, explaining the traditional features—the tatami mats, the sliding paper doors, the way the house was designed to let in as much natural light as possible. Her voice was soft, and she moved with a kind of grace that I found immediately captivating.
That first meeting was brief, but it stayed with me. There was something about her, something calming. Maybe it was the way she seemed so at ease in her surroundings, or the way she spoke with such care. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but I knew I wanted to get to know her better.
Little did I know, that simple tour of the house was the beginning of something much bigger. As the days went on, I found myself drawn to her, to the quiet life she led in this secluded village. Away from the noise and pressure of my usual life, I began to see things differently. And as I spent more time with her, I started to wonder if this place, this life, was what I had been searching for all along.
2.One Month in the Countryside
Honestly, I didn’t plan this trip very well, and it showed—especially in my budget. My girlfriend’s family ran a guesthouse that offered both lodging and traditional Japanese home-cooked meals. But despite staying there for a whole month, I didn’t sign up for a single meal. Later, when I asked her about it, she laughed and told me I was the first guest to do that.
The guesthouse was in a really remote area, far from any convenience stores or restaurants. If I wanted to eat, I had to travel into town, which was an hour’s walk each way. Even the bus fare was too much for my thin wallet, so for the first two weeks, I walked. Every day. An hour there and an hour back, just to grab some food.
Once in town, I’d make the most of the trip. After eating, I’d wander around, checking out the local schoolyards, parks, and any interesting little spots I could find. It was a strange mix of frustrating and liberating. Sure, I was broke, but there was something romantic about aimlessly exploring a foreign place.
That is, until I got reported to the police. One day, as I was wandering near a school, a local resident must have found me suspicious. Before I knew it, I was sitting in a police station, trying to explain myself. Of course, my passport was safely back at the guesthouse, and I didn’t speak a word of Japanese. After a lot of fumbling with my phone, I managed to show them the guesthouse address, and they contacted my girlfriend’s family to confirm I wasn’t some vagrant. They let me go, but not before giving me a long, hard look.
Later, I found out that my girlfriend’s father had told her about me. Apparently, he thought I was a well-meaning but hopelessly clumsy young man and asked her to keep an eye on me, just in case I got into any more trouble.
Before all this, I used to occasionally cross paths with my girlfriend on my way back to the guesthouse. She’d be riding her bike home from school, and we’d just pass each other without much interaction. But after my little adventure with the police, things changed. The next time we ran into each other, she stopped her bike, got off, and started talking to me. Then, we walked back to the guesthouse together.
We talked about why I didn’t take the bus, why I hadn’t signed up for any meals at the guesthouse, and a bunch of other things. With the help of Papago and her limited but surprisingly good Korean, we managed to communicate. I found out she’d been studying a bit of Korean because they had quite a few Korean guests, and she wanted to be able to help out more.
When she asked why I was so stingy, I remember awkwardly repeating, “Okanega naidesukara” (because I have no money). She laughed, but I was dead serious.
She also asked why I was spending a month in Japan. I struggled to explain my situation with medical school, and in the end, I blurted out, “I’m here because I’m at risk of being expelled from university.” Later, she told me that she was puzzled by this. She wondered, “If he’s on the brink of expulsion, why isn’t he studying? Why is he wandering around Japan instead?”
But despite her confusion, she must have felt some kind of sibling-like affection for me, because from that day on, she started bringing me extra food. Since she was the eldest of three siblings, she had this nurturing side, and I guess I triggered that instinct in her. She wasn’t making me full meals like the guesthouse offered, but she did make extra lunch for me when she packed her own for school.
She also lent me an old bicycle they had lying around, so I didn’t have to walk to town anymore. It made the rest of my stay much more comfortable.
At that time, neither of us saw each other as anything more than just acquaintances. I was just thinking, “Wow, Japanese people really are kind,” while she probably thought of me as a hapless younger brother who needed looking after.
Little did we know, that month would lay the foundation for something much deeper.
3. One Month in the Countryside (Part 2)
As the days in the small village passed, I found myself helping out more and more around the guesthouse. In exchange for the food and hospitality, I started assisting with various chores—carrying blankets for guests, moving groceries, and even helping with some of the cleaning. It might sound odd to spend a vacation this way, but without much money and having already explored the entire village, there wasn’t much else for me to do.
After two weeks of wandering around and barely speaking to anyone, I was starving for conversation. The only person I could somewhat communicate with was her—the daughter of the guesthouse owners. She was busy after school, always helping with the family business. Since she was the eldest, a lot of responsibility fell on her shoulders.
At first, she was surprised by my eagerness to help. “You really don’t need to do this,” she insisted, looking at me with a mix of confusion and amusement.
I just shrugged. “I’ve got nothing better to do. Plus, it’s nice to have someone to talk to, even if it’s just while working.”
She didn’t say anything, but I noticed that she didn’t argue much after that. Maybe she realized I wasn’t going to give up. Every time I saw her carrying something or cleaning, I’d appear at her side, asking, “Need help?” or “I’m really not busy, you know.”
Eventually, she just accepted it. “Fine,” she’d say with a small sigh, but I could tell she appreciated the help. Or maybe she just got tired of arguing with me.
One day, as I awkwardly tried to help her fold some blankets, she glanced over at me and smirked. “You’re not very good at this, are you?”
I laughed, realizing I had probably made more of a mess than before. “Yeah, maybe cleaning isn’t my strong suit. But at least I’m good for carrying heavy stuff, right?”
She nodded, still smiling. “Yes, that’s true. You’re very helpful with that.”
The most useful I ever felt was when Korean guests had complaints or requests. My Japanese was far from perfect, and I often relied on translation apps, but it was still easier for me to understand and communicate with them than it was for her. I became the unofficial translator, and I could tell it made things smoother for her.
One evening, after dealing with a particularly picky guest, she turned to me, visibly relieved. “You make things easier, you know.”
I grinned. “Glad to help. I don’t want to just freeload here.”
“You’re not freeloading,” she said earnestly. “You’re helping a lot.”
As the nights grew longer, there were times when she needed to go to the storage shed, which was a bit of a walk from the main house. The first time she asked me to come with her, I didn’t think much of it until we stepped out into the darkness. The village was pitch-black at night, and the silence was almost eerie.
“Are we sure it’s safe out here?” I joked, trying to sound casual, but I couldn’t hide my nervousness.
She looked at me, stifling a laugh. “Are you scared?”
“Scared? No, just… cautious,” I replied, failing to convince even myself.
As we reached the shed, the creaking door didn’t do much to ease my nerves, but she moved around calmly, gathering what she needed. I tried to ignore the unsettling atmosphere, but she noticed my discomfort and chuckled softly. “No monsters here, Min-su. You’re safe.”
“Good to know,” I muttered, feeling a little embarrassed.
On our way back, the tension had lifted, and I found myself talking more freely. We chatted about small things—her school, my time in Japan, and why I had come here in the first place. It wasn’t much, but it felt like we were slowly getting to know each other better.
As my departure date approached, I realized I had grown attached to this routine, to the small, quiet life we had shared for a brief time. Before I left, we exchanged contact information. I had to set up a new account on the spot, but I was determined to keep in touch.
“If you ever visit Korea, let me know,” I told her. “I’ll show you around and repay the favor.”
She smiled, teasing me slightly. “Even if I have no money?”
I laughed, remembering our earlier conversations. “By then, I’ll be working, a proper adult. I’ll take care of everything.”
She nodded, her smile softening. “Just don’t say ‘Okanega naidesukara’ anymore.”
I promised I wouldn’t, and with that, we parted ways. As I boarded the bus back to the city, I couldn’t help but think about how much I had changed in just a month. What started as an escape had turned into something much more meaningful.
