PART 1. 
The moon was hidden behind thick clouds, making the night as dark as ink. Minju held tightly to her mother’s hand as they carefully made their way through the dense forest. The cold wind bit at their faces, but Minju’s grip never wavered. Her mother, blind and frail, relied on her completely. “Mother, are you alright?” Minju whispered, her voice trembling. “I’m fine, Minju,” her mother replied softly. “Just keep leading the way. I trust you.” Around them, other families were moving quietly, their footsteps muffled by the damp earth. Occasionally, someone would stumble, and there would be a hushed exchange of words as they helped each other up.
A man walking nearby turned to Minju. “Do you need help?” he asked, his voice filled with concern. Minju shook her head, even though he couldn’t see her in the darkness. “Thank you, but we’re managing,” she replied. “We just need to keep moving.” As they continued, the sounds of distant explosions rumbled in the night. Minju’s heart pounded in her chest, but she forced herself to stay calm for her mother’s sake. They had to reach Seoul, where safety might be found. “Minju, I can hear the fear in your voice,” her mother said gently. “But remember, we are not alone. We have each other and the kindness of others.”
Minju nodded, though her mother couldn’t see it. “You’re right, Mother. We’ll get through this. Together.” Suddenly, a young boy ahead of them tripped and fell, crying out in pain. His mother quickly knelt beside him, trying to soothe him. Minju instinctively moved forward to help. “Let me carry him,” Minju offered, bending down to lift the boy onto her back. His mother thanked her with tears in her eyes. As they walked, the boy whispered in Minju’s ear, “Are we going to be safe?” Minju hesitated, then spoke with as much confidence as she could muster.
“Yes, we will be. We just have to keep going, and we’ll find safety in Seoul.” The boy nodded against her back, and Minju could feel the tension in his small body ease slightly. She glanced at her mother, who was walking steadily beside her, relying on Minju’s strength and guidance. “You’re doing well, Minju,” her mother said quietly. “Your father would be proud of you.” Minju felt a lump form in her throat at the mention of her father, who had been taken by the war. But she swallowed hard and kept moving. “Thank you, Mother. I just want us to be safe.” They continued through the night, the darkness seeming to stretch endlessly before them. But with each step, they knew they were one step closer to a new beginning.
The relentless cold and gnawing hunger had taken their toll on Minju and her mother. Every step felt heavier, every breath harder. The once comforting silence between them had turned into tense quiet, filled with unspoken frustrations. It wasn’t long before small disagreements began to flare up. “Minju, slow down! I can’t keep up,” her mother pleaded, her voice trembling. “We can’t afford to slow down, Mother,” Minju snapped back, her patience wearing thin. “If we don’t keep moving, we’ll freeze out here.” Her mother’s face fell, and guilt immediately washed over Minju, but the exhaustion drowned it out. They walked in silence after that, both too tired to continue arguing.
One cold, biting dawn, Minju woke up to find her mother still sleeping soundly, her breaths shallow but steady. The thin blanket they shared did little to ward off the cold, and Minju shivered as she stared at her mother. Thoughts that had been creeping into her mind for days now surged forward, thoughts she tried to push away but couldn’t. How much longer could her mother keep going? Minju knew the answer, even if she didn’t want to admit it. She sat up, her body stiff from the cold, and looked around. The other refugees were still sleeping, huddled in small groups for warmth. Her heart pounded as she made a decision she never thought she would make.
Slowly, Minju stood, careful not to make any noise. Her mother’s hand, normally grasping hers tightly, now lay limp by her side. Minju’s throat tightened as she took a step back. She knew what she was about to do was unforgivable, but the desire to survive burned fiercely within her. I’m sorry, Mother, she thought, tears stinging her eyes. But I have to live. She turned and began to walk away, her footsteps silent on the frozen ground. Every step felt like a betrayal, but she kept going, refusing to look back. The dawn’s first light began to creep over the horizon, casting long shadows as Minju disappeared into the distance, leaving her mother behind.
As she walked, the guilt weighed heavier than her exhaustion. She could still hear her mother’s voice in her head, gentle and trusting. “I trust you, Minju.” The words echoed painfully, but she kept moving, trying to silence them. She didn’t stop, even when the tears finally began to fall, knowing that turning back now would only break her completely. Minju was alone now, with only the sound of the wind and her own thoughts for company.
After abandoning her mother, Minju’s journey became even more grueling. Guilt gnawed at her relentlessly, but she forced herself to push forward. She trudged through snow-covered fields, crossed freezing rivers, and endured sleepless nights huddled under makeshift shelters. At times, she thought she would collapse from exhaustion, but the thought of reaching safety kept her going. Days turned into weeks as she moved south, avoiding danger and clinging to the hope that she would survive. Along the way, she met others like her, people who had lost everything but were still fighting to stay alive. They exchanged few words, but their shared struggles spoke volumes.
Finally, one cold morning, Minju found herself standing on the outskirts of Busan. The bustling port city lay sprawled out before her, a stark contrast to the desolate landscapes she had traversed. Ships dotted the horizon, and the sound of distant voices and machinery filled the air. This is it, Minju thought, barely able to believe she had made it. I’m finally here. But as she took her first steps into the city, a wave of overwhelming loneliness hit her. The bustling streets were filled with people, but she had never felt more isolated. I did it, she thought, but the victory felt hollow. I survived.
As she wandered through the crowded streets, Minju couldn’t shake the image of her mother from her mind. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw her mother’s peaceful, sleeping face, unaware that her daughter had left her behind. The thought made Minju’s heart ache, but she knew there was no turning back now. I have to keep moving, she told herself, though the words felt emptier than ever. She found a small corner in a crowded refugee camp, where she sat down and wrapped her arms around her knees. The noise of the city buzzed around her, but Minju felt distant, disconnected from it all.
As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the camp, Minju stared blankly ahead, wondering what her next step would be. I’m here, she thought again, trying to convince herself that this was enough. But deep down, she knew that even though she had reached her destination, a part of her had been lost along the way.
PART 2.
In the bustling streets of Busan, Minju found herself working at a dried fish store in Jagalchi Market. The market was always noisy, filled with the shouts of vendors and the chatter of customers, but it provided Minju with a sense of purpose. Every day, she ran errands, carried goods, and helped wherever she could. The work was hard, and the pay was small, but it was enough to survive. At night, she would return to her tiny room, exhausted but grateful to have made it through another day. This is my life now, she often thought, trying to come to terms with her new reality.
As the years passed, Minju slowly adapted to her life in Busan. She became a familiar face at the market, and the vendors began to look out for her. One of them was a kind woman named Young-sook, who often stopped by the store to buy dried fish. She was older than Minju, with a warm smile and a motherly demeanor. “Minju, you work so hard,” Young-sook said one day, watching Minju carefully stack packages of fish. “Have you ever thought about doing something different? Something more stable?” Minju paused, considering the question. “I’ve thought about it, but… I don’t know what else I could do,” she admitted quietly.
Young-sook nodded thoughtfully. “I know the head nurse at Busan Baik Hospital,” she said after a moment. “They’re always looking for young, hardworking girls to train as nurses. You’re smart and reliable, Minju. I could introduce you.” Minju’s eyes widened in surprise. A nurse? It was something she had never considered, but the idea intrigued her. “Do you really think I could do it?” she asked hesitantly. Young-sook smiled. “I’m sure of it. You’ve already proven how capable you are. Why not give it a try?”
A few weeks later, Minju found herself standing outside Busan Baik Hospital, her heart pounding with nerves. The hospital was a large, imposing building, and the sight of it made her feel small. But Young-sook had been right. The head nurse, impressed by Minju’s work ethic and determination, had agreed to give her a chance. At fifteen, Minju began her training as a nurse. The work was challenging, both physically and emotionally, but Minju threw herself into it with everything she had. She learned quickly, her hands becoming skilled at tending to wounds, administering medicine, and comforting the sick.
As the months went by, Minju grew into her new role. The hospital became her second home, and the nurses and doctors her new family. The chaos of the market was replaced by the steady rhythm of the hospital, where every day was a battle to save lives. But in this new life, Minju found a sense of purpose that had been missing since she fled from Pyongyang. I’m helping people, she thought, and maybe, in some way, I’m making up for what I did.
Despite the hardships Minju had endured, her life as a nurse brought her a sense of peace she hadn’t known in years. The hospital, with its clean hallways and busy wards, became a refuge from the chaos of the world outside. Even though most of her duties involved assisting the more experienced nurses and handling basic tasks, she found immense satisfaction in her work. I’m not just surviving anymore, she would think to herself, I’m helping others survive too. The pride she felt in helping the sick and injured brought her a sense of purpose that had been missing for so long.
In the midst of her busy life at the hospital, Minju also found something she hadn’t expected—friendship. Among the nurses, there were two girls her age, Hee-jin and Young-hee. Both were kind and full of life, and they quickly took Minju under their wing. “Minju, you’re too serious all the time,” Hee-jin teased one afternoon as they sat together in the break room. “You need to laugh more!” Young-hee nodded in agreement. “She’s right! Life is hard enough as it is. You’ve got to find joy where you can.” Minju smiled, feeling a warmth in her chest she hadn’t felt in years. These girls… they’re like the sisters I never had.
The three of them became inseparable, sharing their dreams, worries, and hopes for the future. During their breaks, they would sneak out to a small café near the hospital, where they’d chat about everything from work to their favorite movies. “One day, I’m going to be a head nurse,” Hee-jin declared confidently, stirring her tea. “And you, Minju, you’ll be right there beside me.” Young-hee laughed, raising her cup. “To us! The future queens of Busan Baik Hospital!” Minju joined in the laughter, feeling a lightness she hadn’t experienced in a long time.
For the first time in years, Minju felt like she belonged somewhere. She wasn’t just a refugee trying to survive—she was a young woman with friends, a job, and a future. Though the memories of her past still haunted her, she found solace in the present, surrounded by people who cared for her. Maybe, she thought as she looked around the bustling hospital ward, this is what happiness feels like.
