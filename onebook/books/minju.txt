The night was pitch black, the kind of darkness that made it impossible to see even a few steps ahead.
Minju tightly gripped her mother’s hand as they made their way through the cold, unforgiving night.
“Are you alright, Mother?” Minju whispered, her voice barely audible above the sound of their hurried footsteps.
“I’m fine, Minju,” her mother replied softly. “Just keep holding my hand. I trust you.”
Around them, the murmurs of other refugees filled the air as they moved cautiously through the night.
The sound of boots crunching on frozen ground and the occasional sob of a child echoed in the distance.
“We must stay together,” whispered Mr. Kim, one of their neighbors who walked close by. “The roads are dangerous, and we cannot afford to lose anyone.”
Minju nodded, even though he couldn’t see her in the darkness. “We’ll make it,” she said, more to herself than anyone else. “We have to.”
The cold wind cut through their thin clothing, and Minju could feel her mother’s frail body trembling beside her.
“Is it much further to the port?” her mother asked quietly.
Minju hesitated before answering. “Not much further now, Mother. Just a little longer.”
She wasn’t sure how much farther it really was, but she knew that hope was the only thing keeping them going.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they could see the faint glow of lights in the distance.
“Is that the port?” Minju’s mother asked, hope creeping into her voice.
“Yes, it must be,” Minju replied, her heart pounding with relief. “We’re almost there.”
But as they approached the port, the reality of the situation became clear.
The docks were filled with people, more than Minju had ever seen in one place.
Thousands of desperate faces, all pushing and shoving, trying to get closer to the few ships that were docked.
“There are so many people,” Minju whispered, her voice trembling. “How will we ever get on a ship?”
Mr. Kim looked around, his face grim. “We’ll have to be quick. Not everyone will make it.”
Minju’s heart sank as she realized the truth of his words.
The ships were filling up fast, and there weren’t nearly enough for everyone.
“We have to try,” she said, gripping her mother’s hand even tighter. “We can’t give up now.”
They pushed their way through the crowd, trying to get closer to the front.
“Please, let us through!” Minju called out. “My mother is blind, and we need to get on that ship!”
Some people moved aside, but most were too desperate to care.
The chaos was overwhelming, with people shouting, crying, and fighting to reach the gangways.
As they neared the front, Minju could see the soldiers trying to maintain order, but it was clear they were struggling.
One of the soldiers was helping a family onto the ship, but there were so many others waiting, pleading to be let on.
Minju glanced at her mother, who was clinging to her arm, her face pale and exhausted.
“Mother,” Minju began, her voice shaking, “I… I need to go ahead and find a way to get us on that ship.”
Her mother nodded, trusting her daughter completely. “I’ll be right here, Minju. Just don’t let go of my hand.”
Minju looked around at the frantic crowd, the desperation in their eyes mirroring her own.
Her mind raced, torn between the fear of being left behind and the guilt of what she was about to do.
As the crowd surged forward, Minju felt her mother’s grip loosen for just a moment.
It was in that brief moment that Minju made her decision.
She slowly, carefully, slipped her hand out of her mother’s grasp.
“I’m sorry, Mother,” Minju whispered under her breath, her heart breaking. “I’m so sorry.”
Without looking back, she moved quickly towards the gangway, her small frame slipping through the crowd.
The noise, the chaos, it all blurred together as she focused on one thing: getting on that ship.
She reached the gangway, her breath coming in ragged gasps, and looked up at the soldier guarding it.
“Please,” she begged, her voice barely above a whisper, “let me on.”
The soldier hesitated for a moment, then nodded, lifting her up onto the ship.
As the ship began to pull away from the dock, Minju stood at the railing, looking out at the mass of people still on shore.
Her eyes searched the crowd until she found her mother, standing alone, her face turned towards the ship, as if she knew.
Tears streamed down Minju’s face as she watched her mother slowly disappear from view.
She had made it, but at a cost she wasn’t sure she could ever bear.
As the ship sailed into the night, Minju clung to the railing, her heart heavy with guilt and sorrow.
