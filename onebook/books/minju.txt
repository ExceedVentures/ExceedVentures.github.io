The night was pitch black, the kind of darkness that made it impossible to see even a few steps ahead.
Minju tightly gripped her mother’s hand as they made their way through the cold, unforgiving night.
“Are you alright, Mother?” Minju whispered, her voice barely audible above the sound of their hurried footsteps.
“I’m fine, Minju,” her mother replied softly. “Just keep holding my hand. I trust you.”
Around them, the murmurs of other refugees filled the air as they moved cautiously through the night.
The sound of boots crunching on frozen ground and the occasional sob of a child echoed in the distance.
“We must stay together,” whispered Mr. Kim, one of their neighbors who walked close by. “The roads are dangerous, and we cannot afford to lose anyone.”
Minju nodded, even though he couldn’t see her in the darkness. “We’ll make it,” she said, more to herself than anyone else. “We have to.”
The cold wind cut through their thin clothing, and Minju could feel her mother’s frail body trembling beside her.
“Is it much further to the port?” her mother asked quietly.
Minju hesitated before answering. “Not much further now, Mother. Just a little longer.”
She wasn’t sure how much farther it really was, but she knew that hope was the only thing keeping them going.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they could see the faint glow of lights in the distance.
“Is that the port?” Minju’s mother asked, hope creeping into her voice.
“Yes, it must be,” Minju replied, her heart pounding with relief. “We’re almost there.”
But as they approached the port, the reality of the situation became clear.
The docks were filled with people, more than Minju had ever seen in one place.
Thousands of desperate faces, all pushing and shoving, trying to get closer to the few ships that were docked.
“There are so many people,” Minju whispered, her voice trembling. “How will we ever get on a ship?”
Mr. Kim looked around, his face grim. “We’ll have to be quick. Not everyone will make it.”
Minju’s heart sank as she realized the truth of his words.
The ships were filling up fast, and there weren’t nearly enough for everyone.
“We have to try,” she said, gripping her mother’s hand even tighter. “We can’t give up now.”
They pushed their way through the crowd, trying to get closer to the front.
“Please, let us through!” Minju called out. “My mother is blind, and we need to get on that ship!”
Some people moved aside, but most were too desperate to care.
The chaos was overwhelming, with people shouting, crying, and fighting to reach the gangways.
As they neared the front, Minju could see the soldiers trying to maintain order, but it was clear they were struggling.
One of the soldiers was helping a family onto the ship, but there were so many others waiting, pleading to be let on.
Minju glanced at her mother, who was clinging to her arm, her face pale and exhausted.
“Mother,” Minju began, her voice shaking, “I… I need to go ahead and find a way to get us on that ship.”
Her mother nodded, trusting her daughter completely. “I’ll be right here, Minju. Just don’t let go of my hand.”
Minju looked around at the frantic crowd, the desperation in their eyes mirroring her own.
Her mind raced, torn between the fear of being left behind and the guilt of what she was about to do.
As the crowd surged forward, Minju felt her mother’s grip loosen for just a moment.
It was in that brief moment that Minju made her decision.
She slowly, carefully, slipped her hand out of her mother’s grasp.
“I’m sorry, Mother,” Minju whispered under her breath, her heart breaking. “I’m so sorry.”
Without looking back, she moved quickly towards the gangway, her small frame slipping through the crowd.
The noise, the chaos, it all blurred together as she focused on one thing: getting on that ship.
She reached the gangway, her breath coming in ragged gasps, and looked up at the soldier guarding it.
“Please,” she begged, her voice barely above a whisper, “let me on.”
The soldier hesitated for a moment, then nodded, lifting her up onto the ship.
As the ship began to pull away from the dock, Minju stood at the railing, looking out at the mass of people still on shore.
Her eyes searched the crowd until she found her mother, standing alone, her face turned towards the ship, as if she knew.
Tears streamed down Minju’s face as she watched her mother slowly disappear from view.
She had made it, but at a cost she wasn’t sure she could ever bear.
As the ship sailed into the night, Minju clung to the railing, her heart heavy with guilt and sorrow.
The exhaustion of the journey finally caught up with Minju as she found herself surrounded by countless other refugees on the crowded deck of the ship.
The cold metal beneath her and the soft murmur of voices became distant, and for the first time in days, she felt a strange mix of relief and overwhelming fatigue.
As the ship rocked gently on the waves, Minju’s eyes grew heavy, and despite the chaos around her, she slowly drifted off to sleep, her mind too exhausted to hold on to any thoughts.
When she opened her eyes again, it was to the bright morning sun streaming down on her face.
Disoriented, she sat up and realized that the ship had stopped moving. The bustling noise around her told her that they had arrived.
Minju stood up and looked over the edge of the ship.
There it was—Busan, their destination.
But as she gazed at the unfamiliar landscape, the reality of her situation crashed down on her like a wave.
She had made it to safety, but her mother was gone, lost in the desperate throngs at the port.
Minju’s legs trembled as she stepped off the ship, her eyes scanning the crowds for a familiar face, but there was no one.
The guilt of abandoning her mother, the sorrow of being completely alone—it all overwhelmed her in that moment.
Her vision blurred as tears spilled down her cheeks, and Minju began to sob uncontrollably, her small body shaking with the force of her grief.
It was then that a young American soldier noticed her.
He knelt down beside her, his face kind and concerned, though she couldn’t understand his words.
Seeing her distress, the soldier gently patted her shoulder and led her away from the chaos of the port.
With a few words exchanged with a local, he managed to find a safe place for her—a small orphanage in Busan’s Dong-gu district.
The staff at the orphanage welcomed her with warm smiles and soft words, but all Minju could feel was the cold emptiness inside her.
As the soldier handed her over to the caretakers, Minju looked back at him, trying to say thank you, though the words stuck in her throat.
He gave her a reassuring nod before turning away, leaving her in the hands of the kind strangers who would now be her guardians.
That night, as Minju lay in a small bed in a room full of other children, the silence was deafening.
She clutched the thin blanket to her chest and stared up at the ceiling, the memory of her mother’s hand slipping away from hers replaying over and over in her mind.
She had survived, but the weight of what she had lost seemed too much to bear.
For the first time since the journey began, Minju felt truly alone.
At the age of 10, Minju had been left in the orphanage, and now, five long years had passed.
She had grown from a frightened child into a determined young woman, but the orphanage walls were beginning to feel suffocating.
Minju knew she couldn’t stay there forever, and as she neared adulthood, the pressure to find a job weighed heavily on her.
Every day, she searched for work, but jobs suitable for a young girl like her were few and far between.
Most people saw her as just another orphan with no family and no skills, and the rejection stung each time.
But Minju didn’t give up, knowing that she had to find a way out, a way to build a life for herself.
Then, one day, an unexpected opportunity came her way.
The orphanage director, who had always been kind to Minju, called her into her office with a serious expression.
“Minju,” she said gently, “I’ve heard of an opening at a university hospital in Busan. They’re looking for a nurse assistant.”
Minju’s heart skipped a beat. It was the break she had been hoping for, a chance to prove herself.
“But,” the director continued, “there are others interested in the position as well, so you’ll need to work hard to stand out.”
Determination flared within Minju. “I’ll do whatever it takes,” she replied, her voice steady and resolute.
For the next few weeks, Minju threw herself into preparing for the role.
She studied everything she could about nursing, practiced her skills, and sought advice from anyone who would give it.
The other girls at the orphanage were also vying for the position, and the competition was fierce.
But Minju refused to let her past define her future. She knew this was her chance to escape the orphanage and build a new life.
When the day of the interview arrived, Minju dressed in the best clothes she had, her nerves tightly wound.
She walked into the hospital with her head held high, determined to show them what she was capable of.
After a tense waiting period, the hospital administrators made their decision.
Minju had done it. She had been chosen for the position over the others.
Tears of relief filled her eyes as she thanked the director and promised to make the most of the opportunity.
And so, at 15 years old, Minju began her new life as a nurse assistant at the university hospital.
The work was challenging, and the hours were long, but Minju poured her heart and soul into it.
Every day, she reminded herself that this was just the beginning, and that she had the strength to overcome anything.
