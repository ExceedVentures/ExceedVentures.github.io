Title: Minju  Author: addiction@kakao.com  
PART 1. Minju
The night was pitch black, the kind of darkness that made it impossible to see even a few steps ahead.
Minju tightly gripped her mother’s hand as they made their way through the cold, unforgiving night.
“Are you alright, Mother?” Minju whispered, her voice barely audible above the sound of their hurried footsteps.
“I’m fine, Minju,” her mother replied softly. “Just keep holding my hand. I trust you.”
Around them, the murmurs of other refugees filled the air as they moved cautiously through the night.
The sound of boots crunching on frozen ground and the occasional sob of a child echoed in the distance.
“We must stay together,” whispered Mr. Kim, one of their neighbors who walked close by. “The roads are dangerous, and we cannot afford to lose anyone.”
Minju nodded, even though he couldn’t see her in the darkness. “We’ll make it,” she said, more to herself than anyone else. “We have to.”
The cold wind cut through their thin clothing, and Minju could feel her mother’s frail body trembling beside her.
“Is it much further to the port?” her mother asked quietly.
Minju hesitated before answering. “Not much further now, Mother. Just a little longer.”
She wasn’t sure how much farther it really was, but she knew that hope was the only thing keeping them going.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they could see the faint glow of lights in the distance.
“Is that the port?” Minju’s mother asked, hope creeping into her voice.
“Yes, it must be,” Minju replied, her heart pounding with relief. “We’re almost there.”
But as they approached the port, the reality of the situation became clear.
The docks were filled with people, more than Minju had ever seen in one place.
Thousands of desperate faces, all pushing and shoving, trying to get closer to the few ships that were docked.
“There are so many people,” Minju whispered, her voice trembling. “How will we ever get on a ship?”
Mr. Kim looked around, his face grim. “We’ll have to be quick. Not everyone will make it.”
Minju’s heart sank as she realized the truth of his words.
The ships were filling up fast, and there weren’t nearly enough for everyone.
“We have to try,” she said, gripping her mother’s hand even tighter. “We can’t give up now.”
They pushed their way through the crowd, trying to get closer to the front.
“Please, let us through!” Minju called out. “My mother is blind, and we need to get on that ship!”
Some people moved aside, but most were too desperate to care.
The chaos was overwhelming, with people shouting, crying, and fighting to reach the gangways.
As they neared the front, Minju could see the soldiers trying to maintain order, but it was clear they were struggling.
One of the soldiers was helping a family onto the ship, but there were so many others waiting, pleading to be let on.
Minju glanced at her mother, who was clinging to her arm, her face pale and exhausted.
“Mother,” Minju began, her voice shaking, “I… I need to go ahead and find a way to get us on that ship.”
Her mother nodded, trusting her daughter completely. “I’ll be right here, Minju. Just don’t let go of my hand.”
Minju looked around at the frantic crowd, the desperation in their eyes mirroring her own.
Her mind raced, torn between the fear of being left behind and the guilt of what she was about to do.
As the crowd surged forward, Minju felt her mother’s grip loosen for just a moment.
It was in that brief moment that Minju made her decision.
She slowly, carefully, slipped her hand out of her mother’s grasp.
“I’m sorry, Mother,” Minju whispered under her breath, her heart breaking. “I’m so sorry.”
Without looking back, she moved quickly towards the gangway, her small frame slipping through the crowd.
The noise, the chaos, it all blurred together as she focused on one thing: getting on that ship.
She reached the gangway, her breath coming in ragged gasps, and looked up at the soldier guarding it.
“Please,” she begged, her voice barely above a whisper, “let me on.”
The soldier hesitated for a moment, then nodded, lifting her up onto the ship.
As the ship began to pull away from the dock, Minju stood at the railing, looking out at the mass of people still on shore.
Her eyes searched the crowd until she found her mother, standing alone, her face turned towards the ship, as if she knew.
Tears streamed down Minju’s face as she watched her mother slowly disappear from view.
She had made it, but at a cost she wasn’t sure she could ever bear.
As the ship sailed into the night, Minju clung to the railing, her heart heavy with guilt and sorrow.
The exhaustion of the journey finally caught up with Minju as she found herself surrounded by countless other refugees on the crowded deck of the ship.
The cold metal beneath her and the soft murmur of voices became distant, and for the first time in days, she felt a strange mix of relief and overwhelming fatigue.
As the ship rocked gently on the waves, Minju’s eyes grew heavy, and despite the chaos around her, she slowly drifted off to sleep, her mind too exhausted to hold on to any thoughts.
When she opened her eyes again, it was to the bright morning sun streaming down on her face.
Disoriented, she sat up and realized that the ship had stopped moving. The bustling noise around her told her that they had arrived.
Minju stood up and looked over the edge of the ship.
There it was—Busan, their destination.
But as she gazed at the unfamiliar landscape, the reality of her situation crashed down on her like a wave.
She had made it to safety, but her mother was gone, lost in the desperate throngs at the port.
Minju’s legs trembled as she stepped off the ship, her eyes scanning the crowds for a familiar face, but there was no one.
The guilt of abandoning her mother, the sorrow of being completely alone—it all overwhelmed her in that moment.
Her vision blurred as tears spilled down her cheeks, and Minju began to sob uncontrollably, her small body shaking with the force of her grief.
It was then that a young American soldier noticed her.
He knelt down beside her, his face kind and concerned, though she couldn’t understand his words.
Seeing her distress, the soldier gently patted her shoulder and led her away from the chaos of the port.
With a few words exchanged with a local, he managed to find a safe place for her—a small orphanage in Busan’s Dong-gu district.
The staff at the orphanage welcomed her with warm smiles and soft words, but all Minju could feel was the cold emptiness inside her.
As the soldier handed her over to the caretakers, Minju looked back at him, trying to say thank you, though the words stuck in her throat.
He gave her a reassuring nod before turning away, leaving her in the hands of the kind strangers who would now be her guardians.
That night, as Minju lay in a small bed in a room full of other children, the silence was deafening.
She clutched the thin blanket to her chest and stared up at the ceiling, the memory of her mother’s hand slipping away from hers replaying over and over in her mind.
She had survived, but the weight of what she had lost seemed too much to bear.
For the first time since the journey began, Minju felt truly alone.
At the age of 10, Minju had been left in the orphanage, and now, five long years had passed.
She had grown from a frightened child into a determined young woman, but the orphanage walls were beginning to feel suffocating.
Minju knew she couldn’t stay there forever, and as she neared adulthood, the pressure to find a job weighed heavily on her.
Every day, she searched for work, but jobs suitable for a young girl like her were few and far between.
Most people saw her as just another orphan with no family and no skills, and the rejection stung each time.
But Minju didn’t give up, knowing that she had to find a way out, a way to build a life for herself.
Then, one day, an unexpected opportunity came her way.
The orphanage director, who had always been kind to Minju, called her into her office with a serious expression.
“Minju,” she said gently, “I’ve heard of an opening at a university hospital in Busan. They’re looking for a nurse assistant.”
Minju’s heart skipped a beat. It was the break she had been hoping for, a chance to prove herself.
“But,” the director continued, “there are others interested in the position as well, so you’ll need to work hard to stand out.”
Determination flared within Minju. “I’ll do whatever it takes,” she replied, her voice steady and resolute.
For the next few weeks, Minju threw herself into preparing for the role.
She studied everything she could about nursing, practiced her skills, and sought advice from anyone who would give it.
The other girls at the orphanage were also vying for the position, and the competition was fierce.
But Minju refused to let her past define her future. She knew this was her chance to escape the orphanage and build a new life.
When the day of the interview arrived, Minju dressed in the best clothes she had, her nerves tightly wound.
She walked into the hospital with her head held high, determined to show them what she was capable of.
After a tense waiting period, the hospital administrators made their decision.
Minju had done it. She had been chosen for the position over the others.
Tears of relief filled her eyes as she thanked the director and promised to make the most of the opportunity.
And so, at 15 years old, Minju began her new life as a nurse assistant at the university hospital.
The work was challenging, and the hours were long, but Minju poured her heart and soul into it.
Every day, she reminded herself that this was just the beginning, and that she had the strength to overcome anything.
Working as a nurse assistant was exhausting, but Minju stayed determined, studying nursing in her spare time.
Her friends, Hee-jin and Young-sook, were her support system, making the hard days more bearable.
One weekend, Hee-jin suggested, “Let’s go into the city. We deserve a break.”
Minju hesitated but agreed. The three friends dressed up and headed to Busan’s bustling streets.
They shopped, with Young-sook convincing Minju to buy a dress, saying, “You never know when you’ll need it!”
Afterward, they went to a movie, laughing and enjoying the escape from their routine.
While eating street food, a group of young men approached, trying to flirt.
Hee-jin playfully brushed them off, and the girls continued their evening, sharing stories and laughter.
As they returned to the hospital dorm, Minju felt grateful for the break and the strong friendship they shared.
One day, while sorting laundry, Minju overheard some nurses gossiping about a new patient.
“Did you hear about the woman in the private suite?” one nurse whispered. “They say she’s the wife of a big businessman.”
Another nurse nodded. “She’s well-connected, but no one knows exactly who her husband is.”
Curious, Minju couldn’t help but wonder who this mysterious woman was.
From that day on, Minju found herself visiting the private suite more often, even when she wasn’t assigned there.
She would check in, asking if the woman needed anything, making sure her stay was as comfortable as possible.
At first, it was just small gestures—adjusting her pillows, bringing extra water, or straightening her blankets.
But soon, the visits became more frequent, and Minju started to stay longer, offering her company to the woman.
They talked about simple things—weather, books, and sometimes even life in general.
The woman seemed to appreciate Minju’s kindness, and though she rarely spoke about her life, there was a quiet bond that formed between them.
Minju couldn’t explain why, but she felt drawn to the woman, as if there was something important yet to be discovered.
As Minju continued to care for the woman in the private suite, their bond grew stronger.
What started as routine check-ins turned into longer visits, where they shared conversations about life, family, and the world outside the hospital.
The woman, whom Minju began to affectionately call “Madam,” always appreciated her company.
“Minju,” Madam asked one day, as they sat in the quiet room, “what’s your story? How did a young girl like you end up working here?”
Minju hesitated at first, but the warmth in Madam’s eyes encouraged her to open up.
“I grew up in an orphanage,” Minju began, her voice soft. “After losing my mother during the war, I had nowhere else to go.”
Madam’s expression softened with sympathy. “That must have been so hard for you, dear.”
Minju nodded, fighting back tears. “It was… The orphanage wasn’t easy. We were always struggling. I knew I had to find a way out, so I worked hard, studied when I could, and eventually, I got this job.”
Madam reached out, gently patting Minju’s hand. “You’re a strong young woman. I admire that.”
Encouraged by Madam’s kindness, Minju continued, her voice trembling. “I… I’ve always wondered what happened to my mother. We were separated during the evacuation, and I’ve felt lost ever since.”
She didn’t tell Madam the painful truth—that she had let go of her mother’s hand in the chaos. It was a burden she still carried in silence.
Tears welled up in Minju’s eyes as she spoke, and Madam’s own eyes glistened with empathy.
“I can’t imagine the pain you’ve been through,” Madam whispered, pulling Minju into a comforting embrace. “But you’re not alone anymore, Minju.”
Those words struck deep in Minju’s heart, offering a comfort she hadn’t felt in years.
From that moment on, Minju felt an even stronger connection to Madam. She visited her daily, often staying long after her shifts ended.
They talked about everything—books, dreams, and sometimes just the little things that brought them comfort.
One afternoon, as Madam was preparing for her discharge, she called Minju to her bedside.
“Minju,” she began, her voice soft but firm, “I’ve been thinking a lot about you.”
Minju looked at her curiously, sensing something important was about to be said.
“You’ve become very dear to me,” Madam continued. “I know you don’t have a family of your own, and I… I’ve grown to care for you like a daughter.”
Minju’s heart raced. She hadn’t expected this.
Madam took a deep breath. “I want you to come live with me, Minju. Would you be my adopted daughter?”
Minju stared at her in shock. The offer was beyond anything she could have imagined.
“Are… Are you serious, Madam?” she asked, her voice trembling with emotion.
“Absolutely,” Madam replied, her eyes filled with warmth. “You deserve a family, Minju. And I would be honored if you’d let me be that family.”
Tears streamed down Minju’s face. After years of loneliness and hardship, here was someone offering her a home, a place where she belonged.
“Yes,” Minju whispered, then louder, “Yes, I would love to!”
Madam smiled, tears in her own eyes as she embraced Minju. “Welcome to the family, my dear.”
When the day came for Madam’s discharge, Minju packed her few belongings and left the hospital with her.
As they walked out together, side by side, Minju couldn’t help but think of the orphanage she had called home for so long.
She felt a pang of guilt for leaving it behind, but the thought of starting a new life with Madam filled her with hope.
During the Korean War(6/25), Minju, who had to flee alone, leaving her mother behind, was eventually adopted as the daughter of a famous Korean conglomerate family.
PART2. Yoonho
Yunho was born as the only son in a wealthy family during the Japanese occupation of Korea, in the heart of Gyeongseong (now Seoul). He spent his childhood in a grand traditional Korean house with 99 rooms, the largest type of residence allowed for commoners during the Joseon Dynasty. The estate was enormous, with its wide courtyard, numerous rooms, and intricately designed wooden pillars and latticed doors. The house itself was a small fortress, with polished floors and gardens that bloomed with different flowers each season.
One day, Yunho’s Japanese homeroom teacher from elementary school came for a home visit. As she stepped into the house for the first time, she was stunned by its sheer size and grandeur. From the expansive garden to the seemingly endless corridors and rooms, the teacher found herself overwhelmed. Normally stern and composed in the classroom, she found her confidence evaporating in the face of such opulence. After a brief and awkward tour, she hurriedly left, visibly intimidated by Yunho’s home.
However, the proud household that once exuded warmth and stability began to change. Yunho’s father, who had always been a devoted and caring man, started coming home late at night, reeking of alcohol. The sight of his father stumbling through the door, unsteady on his feet, was both unfamiliar and frightening to Yunho.
As time passed, his father’s behavior worsened. What began as late-night returns soon escalated to nights spent away from home. Sometimes, he would disappear for an entire week, only to return home in a drunken stupor, collapsing into bed and sleeping for days on end. Yunho watched his father with growing confusion, unable to reconcile this new image with the strong, respectable man he had once admired. The once lively and vibrant atmosphere of their home began to darken, and the family members tried to ignore the changes, hoping things would return to normal.
As the years passed, Yunho grew into a middle school student, and the once lively energy of his childhood home continued to dwindle. The house, still grand but now overshadowed by a pervasive gloom, felt colder with each passing season. Winter had come again, its biting winds seeping through the cracks in the wooden doors, and on one such frigid night, Yunho’s younger sister was born.
The arrival of a new family member should have been a joyous occasion, yet that night was marked by a heavy absence—Yunho’s father was nowhere to be found. While his mother labored in the candlelit room, her breath visible in the cold air, and the midwife murmured words of encouragement, Yunho sat in the dimly lit hallway, listening to the distant cries of his newborn sister. He couldn’t help but notice the silence where his father’s reassuring voice should have been.
As the days passed, Yunho learned that his father hadn’t just been absent for his sister’s birth. His father had sold off the family’s ancestral lands—fields that had sustained their family for generations, and even the sacred burial grounds of their ancestors. All of it had been exchanged for money that was quickly squandered on his father’s latest obsession: a journey to Manchuria. There, he indulged in the pleasures of famous taverns, leading a troupe of like-minded companions in a spree that seemed to have no end.
Yunho’s mother often voiced her frustrations, her voice trembling with anger and sorrow as she complained about her husband’s reckless behavior. She lamented the loss of their lands, the disgrace brought upon their family, and the uncertainty of their future. Despite her words, she never broke down in front of Yunho or his sister, always maintaining an air of resilience, though her eyes betrayed her worry.
Yet, despite everything, Yunho couldn’t bring himself to truly hate his father. There was a part of him that still clung to the memory of the man who had once been his hero—the father who had taken him on walks through the family’s fields, who had laughed and played with him in the courtyard of their grand home. Yunho didn’t understand why his father had changed so drastically, why he had seemingly abandoned his family for a life of indulgence and excess, but a small part of him pitied the man who had lost his way.
As he sat in the quiet of his room, listening to the soft breathing of his newborn sister in the next room, Yunho felt a complex mix of emotions. He was angry, confused, and saddened by his father’s actions, but at the same time, he couldn’t shake the feeling that his father’s recklessness was driven by a deeper, unspoken despair.
